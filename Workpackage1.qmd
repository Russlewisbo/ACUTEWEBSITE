## Workpackage 1A Quantitative Relationship of Tpos with Numbers of Viable Gram-Negative Bacteria

### Methods

In this package we will establishing the quantitative relationship of Tpos and KPC- cabrapenemase producing *Klebsiella pneumoniae* inoculum in blood culture bottles. <br> The methods for the assay are a modification of those originally proposed by Kaltsas et al.[@kaltsas2005] Detailed procedures can be found at this [link](Protocols.html). Methodology for preparing the test inoculum was adapted from [CLSI M21A](CLSI_M21A.pdf) and [M26A](CLSI_M26A.pdf) guidelines.[@Clinical_Laboratory_Standards_Institute1999-iy; @Clinical_Laboratory_Standards_Institute1999-iya]

-   Briefly, tubes containing 1.8 mL of pooled healthy human serum are inoculated with 0.2 mL of a series of ten-fold dilutions (5x10^1^ to 5x10^7^ CFU/mL) of the standardised inoculum of each test indicator strains.
-   The sera were are then transferred into BacT⁄ALERT bottles ***without antibiotic inactivating matrix*** (Biomérieux Inc) for aerobic incubation for 24 hours and monitored for time to positivity.
-   Tpos results were used to establish preliminary assay quality control ranges by testing in triplicate for five KPC-carbapenemase producing *K. pneumoniae* strains (KPC_KPCA,B,C and NDM, and VIM producing strains) and a reference *K. pneumoniae* ATCC strain producing ESBL enzyme only. More detailed information on the isolates can be found on the [Protocols](Protocols.html) section.
-   We also compared how Tpos results change if the organism suspension prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS-0.9%) versus pooled human serum (serum).

### Results

The relationship between Tpos and the *K. pneumoniae* inoculum is shown in @fig-inoculum, a linear relationship was observed from approximately 10^1^-10^8^ *K. pneumoniae* CFU/mL and a Tpos measured from 10.5 hours-4.5 hours over the tested inoculum range, with R^2^ of 0.92-0.94. The linear relationship of Tpos versus inoculum was consistent if the inoculum was prepared in PBS or pooled human serum as shown in @tbl-diluent.

::: callout-note
In the original methodology proposed by Kaltsas et al, [@kaltsas2005] the isolate inoculum was reported as the inoculum introduced into the bottle, which already contains between 30-40 mL of growth media (depending on the manufacturer).

Therefore we have followed this precedent of reporting the inoculum introduced into each bottle. This does not represent the final test inoculum that need to account for the total 42 mL volume in each bloodculture bottle.

All experiments were performed using bloodculture bottles ***without antibiotic inactivating matrix***

## Workpackage 1B: Effect of ceftazidime/avibactam exposure on Tpos

This workpackage explores how ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations, alone or in combination with other antibiotics alters Tpos for a standard bacterial inoculum of 1x10 CFU/mL of *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. <br>

### Methods

The effect of increasing fixed ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) concentrations (4:1) on Tpos was investigated at an inoculum of 1x10^4^ CFU/mL of *K. pneumoniae* KPC_B (MIC 1 mg/L) and *K. pneumoniae* NDM producing isolate (negative control, MIC \> 64 mg/L ). All experiments were performed in \> 5 replicates with an incubation period of 24 hours.

### Results

As shown in @fig-cazavitpos, a marked increased in the Tpos for KPC_B from \< 10 hrs to [\>]{.underline} 24 hrs when CAZ/AVI concentrations surpassed 1 mg/L. In contrast, the negative control KPC_NDM strain exhibited consistent Tpos \< 10hr at all test concentrations with lack of antimicrobial activity. Trends in Tpos relative to antibiotic exposure were fitted by Loess.

::: callout-note
Drug concentrations reported in figures represent the concentration of antibiotic injected (1 mL) into the bottle- "simulating" the antibiotic concentrations that would be detected in the bloodstream. These concentrations do not account for 40 mL growth median and inoculum (1 mL) already present in the bottle= total volume 42 mL.

-   The relationship between ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations and Tpos were analyzed by testing increasing concentrations of ceftazidime (0-8 mg/L) and avibactam (fixed ratio 4:1) using the commercial Avycaz (Zavicefta) formulation in at least 5 replicate experiments performed on separate days.
-   Bottles were incubated with 1x10^4^ *Klebsiella pneumoniae* KPC-B strain and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Tpos positivity was registered using the BACTEC Alert/3D software
-   Tpos data versus ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations were then fit to a 4-parameter logistic regression model using the Dose-Response Data Analysis (DRDA) package to estimate PD endpoints.[@drda] Regression results were extracted using the Broom [@broom] and Kableextra [@kableExtra] packages.
-   Results of the pharmacodynamic analysis are shown in @fig-cazavidrkpcb_com. Ceftazidime/avibactam exhibited a steep Tpos response from and EC~50~ of 2.10 (95% CI 2.08-2.12) to and EC~90~ 2.39 (2.33-2.45). As shown in @tbl-cazavidrkpcb_comtbl, the transitional portion of the dose-response curve occurred 1-dilution above the MIC (1 mg/L) that was determined by Etest.

## These data confirm that Tpos recapitulates classical PD endpoints and the relationship of ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations versus Tpos follows classical sigmoidal dose response relationship with a steep transitional portion of the dose response curve that occurs near the MIC of the pathogen. Although ED50/90 estimates were broadly similar if the commercial (patient) and analytical powder formulations were tested, used of high-fixed concentrations of avibactam resulted in lower EC50/90 estimates and broader concentration-effect curves.

## Package 1B: Effect of combination antimicrobial exposure on Tpos

### Methods

-   The activity of combination ceftazidime/avibactam (4 to 1 ratio from commercial formulation) plus gentamicin (0-4 mg/L) was tested against *Klebsiella pneumonia*\_KPC_B strain in 5 replicate experiments.

    ![](test_array.png){width="600"}

-   The effect of the antibiotic combinations Tpos combination was analyzed using a Bliss Independence Model of drug interaction using a workflow described for the [synergy analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BIGL/vignettes/analysis.html) using the BIGL package.[@BIGL]

-   The first step of the fitting procedure will consist in treating marginal data only, i.e. those observations within the experiment where one of the compounds is dosed at zero. For each compound the corresponding marginal doses are modelled using a 4-parameter logistic model

-   The marginal models will be estimated together using non-linear least squares estimation procedure. A simple sum-of-squared-residuals minimization driven by a default Nelder-Mead algorithm from `optim` minimizer was used.

-   Presence of synergistic or antagonistic effects was formalized by means of the meanR and maxR test. `meanR` test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this test suggests that at least some dose combinations may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviour. The `meanR` test is not designed to pinpoint which combinations produce these effects nor what type of deviating effect is present.

-   `maxR` test allows to evaluate presence of synergistic/antagonistic effects for each dose combination and as such provides a point-by-point classification.

### Results

-   The results sown in **Figure 8** demonstrated that CTZ/AVI + gentamicin is broadly synergistic over the range of tested concentrations, with and average 4.29 hr increase (95% CI 2.65-6.46) in Tpos versus the predicted null interactive response of ceftazidime-avibactam and gentamicin alone.

## mean R statistic evaluates how the test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one.

Ceftazidime-avibactam + aztreonam synergy against K. pneumoniae NDM-1 strain.

-   The activity of combination ceftazidime/avibactam (4 to 1 ratio from commercial formulation) plus aztreonam (0-40 mg/L) was tested against *Klebsiella pneumonia*\_KPC_B strain in 3 replicate experiments.
-   The effect of the Tpos combination was analyzed using a Bliss Independence Model of drug interaction using a workflow described for the [synergy analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BIGL/vignettes/analysis.html) using the BIGL package.[@BIGL]
-   The results sown in **Figure 8** demonstrated that CTZ/AVI + aztreonam is broadly synergistic over the range of tested concentrations, **with and average 3.6 hr increase (95% CI 1.76-6.23) in Tpos versus the predicted null interactive response of ceftazidime-avibactam and gentamicin alone.**

### Figure 11.

### Figure 12. In vitro effects of combination ceftazidime/avibactam + aztreonam against NDM-1 producing isolate.

-   The activity of combination ceftazidime/avibactam (4 to 1 ratio from commercial product) plus aztreonam (1.25-40 mg/L) was tested against and NDM-2 producing *Klebsiella pneumoniae* isolate (ceftazidime/avibactam MIC \> 64 mg/L).
-   The effect of the Tpos combination was analyzed using a Bliss Independence Model of Drug interaction.
-   The results demonstrated that CTZ/AVI + aztreonam is broadly synergistic over a range of clinically achieved concentrations, **with an average 8.54 hr (95% CI 8.46-8.60) increase in Tpos versus the predicted null response for each individual drug.**
