    "text": "Establishing the quantitative relationship of TPOS and KPC-Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculum in blood culture bottles.  A modification of the methods proposed by Kaltsas et al.1 Detailed methods can be found following this link.\nBriefly, tubes containing 1.8 mL of pooled healthy human serum were inoculated with 0.2 mL of a series of seven ten-fold dilutions (5x101 to 5x107 CFU/mL) of the standardised inoculum of each test indicator strains. The inoculated sera were then transferred into BacT⁄ALERT bottles without inactivating matrix (Biomérieux Inc) for aerobic incubation and monitored for time to positivity. Tpos results were used to establish preliminary assay quality control ranges by testing in triplicate for five KPC-carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae strains (KPC_KPCA,B,C and NDM, and VIM producing strains) and a reference K. pneumoniae ATCC strain producing ESBL only. Detailed information on the isolates can be found here. We also compared how inoculation of the organism suspension prepared in phosphate buffered saline (pbs-0.9%) versus pooled human serum (serum) affected Tpos.\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between Tpos and the K. pneumoniae inoculum. A linear relationship was observed from approximately 101-108 K. pneumoniae CFU/mL and a Tpos measured from 10.5 hours-4.5 hours over the tested inoculum range, with R2 of 0.92-0.94. These data confirm thatTpos has a wide dynamic range as a surrogate indicator for viable CFU/mL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe need to add an explanation about the actual inoculum in the bottles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary (ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\nwp1 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/wp1a.csv\")\nfig1 <-ggplot(wp1, aes(x=inoculum, y=tpos, color=isolates, shape=diluent, fill=isolates)) + geom_point(size=4, alpha = 0.5) + \nscale_y_continuous(name=\"Time to positivity (Tpos)\", limits=c(4,12)) +\ntheme(legend.text=element_text(size=12)) +\ngeom_smooth(aes(linetype=diluent), method=lm , color=\"black\", fill=\"#69b3a2\", se=TRUE, inherit.aes = TRUE )\nfig1 + theme_bw(base_size = 14)+ scale_x_log10(name=\"Inoculum CFU/mL\", breaks = trans_breaks(\"log10\",n=7, function(x) 10^x),labels = trans_format(\"log10\", math_format(10^.x)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(forestmangr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nwp1 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/wp1a.csv\")\ndf <- data.frame (wp1)\ntable1<-lm_table(df, log(inoculum) ~ tpos, \"diluent\")\nkbl(table1)%>%\nkable_paper(\"hover\", full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    diluent \n    b0 \n    b1 \n    Rsqr \n    Rsqr_adj \n    Std.Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    pbs \n    32.05074 \n    -2.564975 \n    0.9343070 \n    0.9336227 \n    1.110872 \n  \n  \n    serum \n    33.02361 \n    -2.840223 \n    0.9231703 \n    0.9216023 \n    1.210130"

    "text": "Package 1B\nThis workpackage explores how antibiotic concentrations impact Tpos. \nThe effect of increasing fixed ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) concentrations (x:x) on Tpos was investigated at an inoculum of 1x104 CFU/mL of K. pneumoniae KPC_B (MIC X mg/L) and K. pneumonia NDM producing isolate (negative control, MIC X mg/L ). All experiments were performed in triplicate with an incubation period of 24 hours. Figure 2 shows a marked increased in the Tpos for KPC_B from < 10 hrs to > 24 hrs when CAZ/AVI concentrations surpassed 1 mg/L. In contrast, the negative control KPC_NDM strain exhibited consistent Tpos < 10hr at all test concentrations consistent with lack of antimicrobial activity.\n\nFigure 2.
