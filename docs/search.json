    "text": "The project will generate fundamental knowledge of how Tpos correlated with established pharmacodynamic indices (e.g. AUC/MIC, %T> MIC). The activity of ceftazidime-avibactam montherapy and combination anibiotic regimens in vitro and from patients against KPC-carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) will be tested as proof-of-concept. \nTe objectives of this project will be accomplished through two specific aims and several workpackages.\n\nThe first specific aim will establish the quantitative relationships between Tpos and several representative KPC-Kp strains in the absence and after exposure to a range of clinically-relevant exposures of ceftazidime-avibactam.\nThe second specific aim will measure Tpos from the blood of 20 critically-ill patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam treatment for KPC-KP bloodstream infections using KPC-Kp “indicator” strains or the patient’s own isolate. Tpos results will be correlated with blood concentration-time courses of ceftazidime and avibactam and PK/PD target attainment (free drug T>MIC ) simulated for each patient using Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from population pharmacokinetic models and LC/MS/MS analysis of ceftazidime-avibactam in serum.\n\nThis study will form the basis for the broader development and validation of Tpos as a surrogate pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for antimicrobial activity in serum, that could potentially be used for screening or monitoring antimicrobial efficacy in the critically-ill patients."

[@kaltsas2005]\nDilution schemes are from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M21-A Methodology for the Serum Bactericidal Test [@Clinical_Laboratory_Standards_Institute1999-iya]and M26A Methodology for Determining Bactericidal Activity of Antibiotics [@Clinical_Laboratory_Standards_Institute1999-iy]\nTo prepare a standardized inoculum (1.5 x102 CFU/mL) for injection in blood culture bottles:\n\nColonies are selected from an 18- to 24-hour agar plate and suspended in sterile 0.9% phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a glass test tube. The suspension is then adjusted by optimal density using a Densichek turbidity meter to an equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard corresponding to 1 to 2 × 108 CFU/mL.\nThe inoculum is then serially diluted using ten-fold dilution scheme: 200 μL inoculum dispensed by micropipette into 1800 μL 0.9% saline → vortexed → then 200 μL of this suspension is pipetted into a fresh tube containing 1800 μL 0.9% saline, etc.) until a final inoculum of 1.5 x102 CFU/ml is reached.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Inoculum dilution scheme\n\n\n\nNote the final dilution step is repeated an additional 5 times in replicate tubes to ensure 6 tubes (12 mL of the final 1.5 x102 CFU/mL) are available to inoculate 10 blood culture bottles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical grade (> 99% pure) ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL) pure powder are diluted separately in sterile water to prepare a stock solution of ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL). The stock solution is dispensed into 2 mL sterile cryo-vials and stored at -20°C.\nFrozen stock antibiotic solution in cryo-vials is thawed the day of the experiment and diluted at twice the final test concentration using either (a) pooled patient serum; or (b) 0.9% PBS.\n\nExample: to obtain 2 mL of 20 mcg/ml stock: 200 μL of ceftazidime 200 mg/mL solution is pipetted into a test-tube containing 1800 μL of serum\nExample to obtain 50 μg/mL: using the multipipettor set at 500 μL, 500 μL of ceftazidime 200 μg/ml solution are added in a tube containing 1500 μL of serum\n500 μL of the ceftazidime 2x concentration and 500 μL of the 2x avibactam concentration are then added in a test tube to obtain 1 ml of serum-antibiotic solution at the desired concentrations\n\nAfter vortexing for 7-10 seconds each tube, 1 ml of inoculum suspension at 1.5x102 CFU/mL and 1 mL of antibiotic containing serum are inoculated with a sterile insulin syringe into a blood culture bottle containing 40 mL of enrichment broth without inactivating matrix.\nBloodcultre bottles are then incubated into Bact/ALERT system to detect growth. The same procedure is repeated for all the selected antibiotic concentration-inoculum pairs.\nOne bottle is inoculated with the bacterial inoculum without adding the antibiotic solution (drug-free control).\ndescribe incubation conditions, incubator settings, etc. \nhow are data collected from the software etc."
