    "text": "The project will generate fundamental knowledge of how Tpos correlates with established pharmacodynamic indices (e.g. AUC/MIC, %T> MIC). The activity of ceftazidime-avibactam monotherapy and combination antibiotic regimens will be tested in vitro and using sera from patients undergoing treatment for KPC-carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp). \nTe objectives of this project will be accomplished through two specific aims and several workpackages:\n\nThe first specific aim will establish the quantitative relationship between Tpos and representative KPC-Kp strains in the absence and presence of clinically-relevant antibiotic exposures.\nThe second specific aim will measure Tpos using sera from 20 critically-ill patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam treatment for KPC-KP bloodstream infections using KPC-Kp “indicator” strains or the patient’s own isolate. Tpos results will be correlated with blood concentration-time courses of ceftazidime and avibactam and PK/PD target attainment (free drug T>MIC ) simulated for each patient using Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from population pharmacokinetic models and LC/MS/MS analysis of ceftazidime-avibactam drug concentrations in serum.\n\nThis study will form the basis for the broader development and validation of Tpos as a surrogate pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for monitoring antimicrobial activity of antibiotic monotherapy and combination therapy for Gram-negative infections."

    "text": "Establishing the quantitative relationship of TPOS and KPC-Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculum in blood culture bottles.  A modification of the methods proposed by Kaltsas et al.1 Detailed methods can be found following this link. Methodology for preparing the test inoculum was adapted from CLSI M21A and M26A guidelines.2,3\nBriefly, tubes containing 1.8 mL of pooled healthy human serum were inoculated with 0.2 mL of a series of seven ten-fold dilutions (5x101 to 5x107 CFU/mL) of the standardised inoculum of each test indicator strains. The inoculated sera were then transferred into BacT⁄ALERT bottles without inactivating matrix (Biomérieux Inc) for aerobic incubation and monitored for time to positivity. Tpos results were used to establish preliminary assay quality control ranges by testing in triplicate for five KPC-carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae strains (KPC_KPCA,B,C and NDM, and VIM producing strains) and a reference K. pneumoniae ATCC strain producing ESBL only. Detailed information on the isolates can be found here. We also compared how inoculation of the organism suspension prepared in phosphate buffered saline (pbs-0.9%) versus pooled human serum (serum) affected Tpos.\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between Tpos and the K. pneumoniae inoculum. A linear relationship was observed from approximately 101-108 K. pneumoniae CFU/mL and a Tpos measured from 10.5 hours-4.5 hours over the tested inoculum range, with R2 of 0.92-0.94.

    "text": "Package 1B\nThis workpackage explores how antibiotic concentrations impact Tpos. \nThe effect of increasing fixed ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) concentrations (x:x) on Tpos was investigated at an inoculum of 1x104 CFU/mL of K. pneumoniae KPC_B (MIC X mg/L) and K. pneumonia NDM producing isolate (negative control, MIC X mg/L ). All experiments were performed in triplicate with an incubation period of 24 hours. Figure 2 shows a marked increased in the Tpos for KPC_B from < 10 hrs to > 24 hrs when CAZ/AVI concentrations surpassed 1 mg/L. In contrast, the negative control KPC_NDM strain exhibited consistent Tpos < 10hr at all test concentrations consistent with lack of antimicrobial activity.\n\nFigure 2.

The suspension is then adjusted by optimal density using a Densichek turbidity meter to an equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard corresponding to 1 to 2 × 108 CFU/mL.\nThe inoculum is then serially diluted using ten-fold dilution scheme: 200 μL inoculum dispensed by micropipette into 1800 μL 0.9% saline → vortexed → then 200 μL of this suspension is pipetted into a fresh tube containing 1800 μL 0.9% saline, etc.) until a final inoculum of 1.5 x102 CFU/ml is reached.\n\nNote the final dilution step is repeated an additional 5 times in replicate tubes to ensure 6 tubes (12 mL of the final 1.5 x102 CFU/mL) are available to inoculate 10 blood culture bottles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical grade (> 99% pure) ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL) pure powder are diluted separately in sterile water to prepare a stock solution of ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL). The stock solution is dispensed into 2 mL sterile cryo-vials and stored at -20°C.\nFrozen stock antibiotic solution in cryo-vials is thawed the day of the experiment and diluted at twice the final test concentration using either (a) pooled patient serum; or (b) 0.9% PBS.\n\nExample: to obtain 2 mL of 20 mcg/ml stock: 200 μL of ceftazidime 200 mg/mL solution is pipetted into a test-tube containing 1800 μL of serum\nExample to obtain 50 μg/mL: using the multipipettor set at 500 μL, 500 μL of ceftazidime 200 μg/ml solution are added in a tube containing 1500 μL of serum\n500 μL of the ceftazidime 2x concentration and 500 μL of the 2x avibactam concentration are then added in a test tube to obtain 1 ml of serum-antibiotic solution at the desired concentrations\n\nAfter vortexing for 7-10 seconds each tube, 1 ml of inoculum suspension at 1.5x102 CFU/mL and 1 mL of antibiotic containing serum are inoculated with a sterile insulin syringe into a blood culture bottle containing 40 mL of enrichment broth without inactivating matrix.\nBloodcultre bottles are then incubated into Bact/ALERT system to detect growth.
