The methods for the assay are a modification of those originally proposed by Kaltsas et al.1 Detailed procedures can be found at this link. Methodology for preparing the test inoculum was adapted from CLSI M21A and M26A guidelines.2,3\n\nBriefly, tubes containing 1.8 mL of pooled healthy human serum are inoculated with 0.2 mL of a series of ten-fold dilutions (5x101 to 5x107 CFU/mL) of the standardised inoculum of each test indicator strains.\nThe sera were are then transferred into BacT⁄ALERT bottles without antibiotic inactivating matrix (Biomérieux Inc) for aerobic incubation for 24 hours and monitored for time to positivity.\nTpos results were used to establish preliminary assay quality control ranges by testing in triplicate for five KPC-carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae strains (KPC A, B and C strains; NDM, and VIM producing strains) and a reference K. pneumoniae ATCC strain producing ESBL enzyme only. More detailed information on the isolates can be found on the Protocols section.\nWe also compared how Tpos results change if the organism suspension prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS-0.9%) versus pooled human serum (serum).\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Tpos and the K. pneumoniae inoculum is shown in Figure 1 a linear relationship was observed from approximately 101-108 K. pneumoniae CFU/mL and a Tpos measured from 10.5 hours-4.5 hours over the tested inoculum range, with R2 of 0.92-0.94. The linear relationship of Tpos versus inoculum was consistent if the inoculum was prepared in PBS or pooled human serum as shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the original methodology proposed by Kaltsas et al,1 the isolate inoculum was reported as the inoculum introduced into the bottle, which already contains between 30-40 mL of growth media (depending on the manufacturer).\nTherefore we have followed this precedent of reporting the inoculum introduced into each bottle. This does not represent the final test inoculum that need to account for the total 42 mL volume in each bloodculture bottle.\nAll experiments were performed using bloodculture bottles without antibiotic inactivating matrix\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary (ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n## import raw data from .csv file\nwp1 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/wp1a.csv\")\n## plot raw data as x-y graph Tpos graph vs. drug concentrations stratified by dilution matrix, method=\"lm\" is the method for linear regression\nfig1 <-ggplot(wp1, aes(x=inoculum, y=tpos, color=isolates, shape=diluent, fill=isolates)) + geom_point(size=4, alpha = 0.5) + \nscale_y_continuous(name=\"Tpos (hr)\", limits=c(4,12)) +\ntheme(legend.text=element_text(size=12)) +\ngeom_smooth(aes(linetype=diluent), method=lm , color=\"black\", fill=\"#69b3a2\", se=TRUE, inherit.aes = TRUE )\nfig1 + theme_bw(base_size = 14)+ scale_x_log10(name=\"Inoculum CFU/mL\", breaks = trans_breaks(\"log10\",n=7, function(x) 10^x),labels = trans_format(\"log10\", math_format(10^.x)))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship of time-to-positivity (Tpos) versus test inoculum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(forestmangr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nwp1 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/wp1a.csv\")\ndf <- data.frame (wp1)\ntable1<-lm_table(df, log(inoculum) ~ tpos, \"diluent\")\nkbl(table1)%>%\nkable_paper(\"hover\", full_width = F, position=\"left\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Effect of inoculum diluent on Tpos \n \n  \n    diluent \n    b0 \n    b1 \n    Rsqr \n    Rsqr_adj \n    Std.Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    pbs \n    32.05074 \n    -2.564975 \n    0.9343070 \n    0.9336227 \n    1.110872 \n  \n  \n    serum \n    33.02361 \n    -2.840223 \n    0.9231703 \n    0.9216023 \n    1.210130 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data confirm that Tpos exhibits a wide dynamic range as a surrogate indicator for viable CFU/mL."

All experiments were performed in > 5 replicates with an incubation period of 24 hours.\n\n\nResults\nAs shown in Figure 2, a marked increased in the Tpos for KPC_B from < 10 hrs to > 24 hrs when CAZ/AVI concentrations surpassed 1 mg/L. In contrast, the negative control KPC_NDM strain exhibited consistent Tpos < 10hr at all test concentrations with lack of antimicrobial activity. Trends in Tpos relative to antibiotic exposure were fitted by Loess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDrug concentrations reported in figures represent the concentration of antibiotic injected (1 mL) into the bottle- “simulating” the antibiotic concentrations that would be detected in the bloodstream.

ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations versus Tpos follows classical sigmoidal dose response relationship with a steep transitional portion of the dose response curve that occurs near the MIC of the pathogen.Although ED50/90 estimates were broadly similar if the commercial (pharmaceutical) and analytical powder formulations were tested, used of high-fixed concentrations of avibactam or testing at very high K. pneumoniae inocula resulted in broader concentration-effect curves and higher EC50/90 estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeropenem\n\nATCC isolate (MIC )\n\nThe impact of increasing meropenem concentrations on Tpos observed with the ATCC ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was tested using similar methodology as previously described\nAnalytical powder was used to produce serum concentration\nAs shown in Figure 10 , Tpos increased as meropenem concentrations surpassed the MIC, with an estimated pharmacodynamic parameters consistent with previous experiments that showed transition in the EC50/EC90 at simulated serum concentrations near the MIC as shown in Table 10.\n\n\n\nCode\n## a four-parameter logistic regression model is fit to meropenem concentrations to

    "text": "Workpackage 1C: Effect of combination antimicrobial exposure on Tpos\n\nMethods\n\nThe activity of combination ceftazidime/avibactam (4 to 1 ratio from commercial formulation) plus gentamicin (0-4 mg/L) was tested against Klebsiella pneumonia KPCB strain in 5 replicate experiments using an array of test concentrations.\n\n\n\nTest array\n\n\nThe effect of the antibiotic combinations Tpos combination was analyzed using a Bliss Independence Model of drug interaction using a workflow described for the synergy analysis using the BIGL package.7\nThe first step of the fitting procedure analyzed marginal data only, i.e. those observations within the experiment where one of the compounds is dosed at zero. For each compound the corresponding marginal doses are modelled using a 4-parameter logistic model\nThe marginal models will be estimated together using non-linear least squares estimation procedure. A simple sum-of-squared-residuals minimization driven by a default Nelder-Mead algorithm from optim minimizer was used.\nPresence of synergistic or antagonistic effects was formalized by means of the meanR and maxR test. meanR test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this test suggests that at least some dose combinations may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviour. The meanR test is not designed to pinpoint which combinations produce these effects nor what type of deviating effect is present.\nmaxR test allows to evaluate presence of synergistic/antagonistic effects for each dose combination and as such provides a point-by-point classification.\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nCeftazidime-avibactam + gentamicin\n\nThe results shown in ?@fig-10 demonstrated that CTZ/AVI + gentamicin is broadly synergistic over the range of tested concentrations, with and average 4.29 hr increase (95% CI 2.65-6.46) in Tpos versus the predicted null interactive response of ceftazidime-avibactam and gentamicin alone.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(BIGL)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(rgl)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nset.seed(12345)\ncutoff <- 0.95\ncaz_gent_kpcb2 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/datasets/caz_gent_kpcb2.csv\")\n## Fitting marginal models, maximal fixed at 24 hours, minimal at 9.5 hours\nmarginalFit <- fitMarginals(caz_gent_kpcb2, method = \"optim\",                 \n                            fixed = c(\"m1\" = 24, \"m2\" = 24, \"b\" = 9.5),\n                            names = c(\"CTZ/AVI\", \"GENT\"))\nsummary(marginalFit)\n\n\nFormula: effect ~ fn(h1, h2, b = 19/2, m1 = 24, m2 = 24, e1, e2, d1, d2)\nTransformations: No\n\n                 CTZ/AVI   GENT\nSlope             10.476 14.303\nMaximal response  24.000 24.000\nlog10(EC50)        0.336 -0.273\n\nCommon baseline at: 9.5\n\n\nCode\n## Plotting marginal model for ceftazidime and gentamicin, minimum constrained at 9 hrs and maximum contrastined at 24 hours\nplot(marginalFit) + ggtitle(paste(\"Ceftazidime/Avibactam + Gentamicin\"))\nrs <- fitSurface(caz_gent_kpcb2, marginalFit,\n                 null_model = \"bliss\",\n                 B.CP = 50, statistic = \"none\", parallel = FALSE)\nsummary(rs)\n\n\nNull model: Bliss independence with shared maximal response\nVariance assumption used: \"equal\"\n\nFormula: effect ~ fn(h1, h2, b = 19/2, m1 = 24, m2 = 24, e1, e2, d1, d2)\nTransformations: No\n\n                 CTZ/AVI   GENT\nSlope             10.476 14.303\nMaximal response  24.000 24.000\nlog10(EC50)        0.336 -0.273\n\nCommon baseline at: 9.5\n\n\n\nNo test statistics were computed.\nCONFIDENCE INTERVALS\nOverall effect\nEstimated mean departure from null response surface with 95% confidence interval:\n2.7219 [1.9384, 3.4526]\nEvidence for effects in data: Syn \n\nSignificant pointwise effects\n        estimate  lower   upper call\n0.5_0.5   7.1271 3.9675 10.2868  Syn\n1_0.5     9.5615 7.3893 11.7337  Syn\n2_0.125  10.1205 4.9977 15.2433  Syn\n2_0.25    9.6203 7.4834 11.7572  Syn\n2_0.5     7.2429 4.7046  9.7812  Syn\n\nPointwise 95% confidence intervals summary:\n Syn Ant Total\n   5   0    19\n\n\nCode\nplot(rs, legend = FALSE, main = \"\")\nview3d(0, -75)\nrglwidget()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Effect of combined ceftazidime/avibactam and gentamicin effects on Tpos\n\n\n\nCode\n## mean R statistic evaluates how the test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one.
