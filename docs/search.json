    "text": "The ACUTE project proposes to develop time-to positivity (Tpos) - a commonly reported index from continuously monitored bloodculture systems used in clinical microbiology laboratories- as a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker for monitoring antibiotic therapy of multidrug resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria.\nThe project will generate fundamental knowledge of how Tpos correlates with established pharmacodynamic indices for antibiotics(e.g. AUC/MIC, %T>MIC). The activity of ceftazidime-avibactam monotherapy, and combination antibiotic regimens, will be tested in vitro and then in sera from patients undergoing treatment for KPC-carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of this project will be accomplished through two specific aims and several workpackages:\n\nThe first specific aim will establish the quantitative relationship between Tpos and representative KPC-Kp strains in the absence and presence of clinically-relevant antibiotic exposures.\nThe second specific aim will measure Tpos using sera from 20 critically-ill patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam treatment for KPC-KP bloodstream infections using “indicator” strains or the patient’s own isolate. Tpos results will be correlated with blood concentration-time courses of ceftazidime and avibactam and PK/PD target attainment (free drug T>MIC ) simulated for each patient using Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from population pharmacokinetic models and LC/MS/MS analysis of ceftazidime-avibactam drug concentrations in serum.\n\nThis study will form the basis for the broader development and validation of Tpos as a surrogate pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for monitoring antimicrobial activity of antibiotic monotherapy and combination therapy for Gram-negative infections."

The methods for the assay are a modification of those originally proposed by Kaltsas et al.1 Detailed procedures can be found at this link. Methodology for preparing the test inoculum was adapted from CLSI M21A and M26A guidelines.2,3\n\nBriefly, tubes containing 1.8 mL of pooled healthy human serum are inoculated with 0.2 mL of a series of ten-fold dilutions (5x101 to 5x107 CFU/mL) of the standardised inoculum of each test indicator strains.\nThe sera were are then transferred into BacT⁄ALERT bottles without antibiotic inactivating matrix (Biomérieux Inc) for aerobic incubation for 24 hours and monitored for time to positivity.\nTpos results were used to establish preliminary assay quality control ranges by testing in triplicate for five KPC-carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae strains (KPC_KPCA,B,C and NDM, and VIM producing strains) and a reference K. pneumoniae ATCC strain producing ESBL enzyme only. More detailed information on the isolates can be found on the Protocols section.\nWe also compared how Tpos results change if the organism suspension prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS-0.9%) versus pooled human serum (serum).\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between Tpos and the K. pneumoniae inoculum is shown in Figure 1 a linear relationship was observed from approximately 101-108 K. pneumoniae CFU/mL and a Tpos measured from 10.5 hours-4.5 hours over the tested inoculum range, with R2 of 0.92-0.94. The linear relationship of Tpos versus inoculum was consistent if the inoculum was prepared in PBS or pooled human serum as shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the original methodology proposed by Kaltsas et al,1 the isolate inoculum was reported as the inoculum introduced into the bottle, which already contains between 30-40 mL of growth media (depending on the manufacturer).\nTherefore we have followed this precedent of reporting the inoculum introduced into each bottle.

In contrast, the negative control KPC_NDM strain exhibited consistent Tpos < 10hr at all test concentrations with lack of antimicrobial activity. Trends in Tpos relative to antibiotic exposure were fitted by Loess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDrug concentrations reported in figures represent the concentration of antibiotic injected (1 mL) into the bottle- “simulating” the antibiotic concentrations that would be detected in the bloodstream.

    "text": "Package 1B: Effect of combination antimicrobial exposure on Tpos\n\nMethods\n\nThe activity of combination ceftazidime/avibactam (4 to 1 ratio from commercial formulation) plus gentamicin (0-4 mg/L) was tested against Klebsiella pneumonia KPCB strain in 5 replicate experiments using an array of test concentrations.\n\n\n\nTest array\n\n\nThe effect of the antibiotic combinations Tpos combination was analyzed using a Bliss Independence Model of drug interaction using a workflow described for the synergy analysis using the BIGL package.7\nThe first step of the fitting procedure analyzed marginal data only, i.e. those observations within the experiment where one of the compounds is dosed at zero. For each compound the corresponding marginal doses are modelled using a 4-parameter logistic model\nThe marginal models will be estimated together using non-linear least squares estimation procedure. A simple sum-of-squared-residuals minimization driven by a default Nelder-Mead algorithm from optim minimizer was used.\nPresence of synergistic or antagonistic effects was formalized by means of the meanR and maxR test. meanR test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this test suggests that at least some dose combinations may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviour. The meanR test is not designed to pinpoint which combinations produce these effects nor what type of deviating effect is present.\nmaxR test allows to evaluate presence of synergistic/antagonistic effects for each dose combination and as such provides a point-by-point classification.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThe results shown in ?@fig-10 demonstrated that CTZ/AVI + gentamicin is broadly synergistic over the range of tested concentrations, with and average 4.29 hr increase (95% CI 2.65-6.46) in Tpos versus the predicted null interactive response of ceftazidime-avibactam and gentamicin alone.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(BIGL)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(rgl)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nset.seed(12345)\ncutoff <- 0.95\ncaz_gent_kpcb <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/datasets/caz_gent_kpcb.csv\")\n## Fitting marginal models, maximal fixed at 24 hours, minimal at 9 hours\nmarginalFit <- fitMarginals(caz_gent_kpcb, method = \"optim\",                 \n                            fixed = c(\"m1\" = 24, \"m2\" = 24, \"b\" = 9),\n                            names = c(\"CTZ/AVI\", \"GENT\"))\nsummary(marginalFit)\n\n\nFormula: effect ~ fn(h1, h2, b = 9, m1 = 24, m2 = 24, e1, e2, d1, d2)\nTransformations: No\n\n                 CTZ/AVI   GENT\nSlope              2.948  6.675\nMaximal response  24.000 24.000\nlog10(EC50)        0.485 -0.246\n\nCommon baseline at: 9\n\n\nCode\n## Plotting marginal model for ceftazidime and gentamicin, minimum constrained at 9 hrs and maximum contrastined at 24 hours\nplot(marginalFit) + ggtitle(paste(\"Ceftazidime/Avibactam + Gentamicin\"))\nrs <- fitSurface(caz_gent_kpcb, marginalFit,\n                 null_model = \"bliss\",\n                 B.CP = 50, statistic = \"none\", parallel = FALSE)\nsummary(rs)\n\n\nNull model: Bliss independence with shared maximal response\nVariance assumption used: \"equal\"\n\nFormula: effect ~ fn(h1, h2, b = 9, m1 = 24, m2 = 24, e1, e2, d1, d2)\nTransformations: No\n\n                 CTZ/AVI   GENT\nSlope              2.948  6.675\nMaximal response  24.000 24.000\nlog10(EC50)        0.485 -0.246\n\nCommon baseline at: 9\n\n\n\nNo test statistics were computed.\nCONFIDENCE INTERVALS\nOverall effect\nEstimated mean departure from null response surface with 95% confidence interval:\n4.0374 [1.1143, 7.5135]\nEvidence for effects in data: Syn \n\nSignificant pointwise effects\n        estimate  lower   upper call\n0.5_0.5   5.5789 1.1548 10.0031  Syn\n1_0.5     9.1981 6.2674 12.1288  Syn\n2_0.25   11.1988 7.7384 14.6592  Syn\n2_0.5     8.1567 4.3602 11.9531  Syn\n\nPointwise 95% confidence intervals summary:\n Syn Ant Total\n   4   0    12\n\n\nCode\nplot(rs, legend = FALSE, main = \"\")\nview3d(0, -75)\nrglwidget()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Effect of combined ceftazidime/avibactam and gentamicin effects on Tpos\n\n\n\nCode\n## mean R statistic evaluates how the test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one.

The suspension is then adjusted by optimal density using a Densichek turbidity meter to an equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard corresponding to 1 to 2 × 108 CFU/mL.\nThe inoculum is then serially diluted using ten-fold dilution scheme: 200 μL inoculum dispensed by micropipette into 1800 μL 0.9% saline → vortexed → then 200 μL of this suspension is pipetted into a fresh tube containing 1800 μL 0.9% saline, etc.) until a final inoculum of 1.5 x102 CFU/ml is reached.\n\nNote the final dilution step is repeated an additional 5 times in replicate tubes to ensure 6 tubes (12 mL of the final 1.5 x102 CFU/mL) are available to inoculate 10 blood culture bottles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical grade (> 99% pure) ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL) pure powder are diluted separately in sterile water to prepare a stock solution of ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL). The stock solution is dispensed into 2 mL sterile cryo-vials and stored at -20°C.\nFrozen stock antibiotic solution in cryo-vials is thawed the day of the experiment and diluted at twice the final test concentration using either (a) pooled patient serum; or (b) 0.9% PBS.\n\nExample: to obtain 2 mL of 20 mcg/ml stock: 200 μL of ceftazidime 200 mg/mL solution is pipetted into a test-tube containing 1800 μL of serum\nExample to obtain 50 μg/mL: using the multipipettor set at 500 μL, 500 μL of ceftazidime 200 μg/ml solution are added in a tube containing 1500 μL of serum\n500 μL of the ceftazidime 2x concentration and 500 μL of the 2x avibactam concentration are then added in a test tube to obtain 1 ml of serum-antibiotic solution at the desired concentrations\n\nAfter vortexing for 7-10 seconds each tube, 1 ml of inoculum suspension at 1.5x102 CFU/mL and 1 mL of antibiotic containing serum are inoculated with a sterile insulin syringe into a blood culture bottle containing 40 mL of enrichment broth without inactivating matrix.\nBloodculture bottles are then incubated into Bact/ALERT system to detect growth. The same procedure is repeated for all the selected antibiotic concentration-inoculum pairs.\nOne bottle is inoculated with the bacterial inoculum without adding the antibiotic solution (drug-free control).\ndescribe incubation conditions, incubator settings, etc. \nhow are data collected from the software etc."
