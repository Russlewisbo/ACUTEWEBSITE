    "text": "Establishing the quantitative relationship of Tpos and KPC-Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculum in blood culture bottles.  The methods for the assay are a modification of those originally proposed by Kaltsas et al.1 Detailed procedures can be found following this link. Methodology for preparing the test inoculum was adapted from CLSI M21A and M26A guidelines.2,3\nBriefly, tubes containing 1.8 mL of pooled healthy human serum were inoculated with 0.2 mL of a series of ten-fold dilutions (5x101 to 5x107 CFU/mL) of the standardised inoculum of each test indicator strains. The inoculated sera were then transferred into BacT⁄ALERT bottles without inactivating matrix (Biomérieux Inc) for aerobic incubation for 24 hours and monitored for time to positivity. Tpos results were used to establish preliminary assay quality control ranges by testing in triplicate for five KPC-carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae strains (KPC_KPCA,B,C and NDM, and VIM producing strains) and a reference K. pneumoniae ATCC strain producing ESBL enzyme only. Detailed information on the isolates can be found here. We also compared how inoculation of the organism suspension prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS-0.9%) versus pooled human serum (serum) affected Tpos.\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between Tpos and the K. pneumoniae inoculum. A linear relationship was observed from approximately 101-108 K. pneumoniae CFU/mL and a Tpos measured from 10.5 hours-4.5 hours over the tested inoculum range, with R2 of 0.92-0.94. These data confirm that Tpos exhibits a wide dynamic range as a surrogate indicator for viable CFU/mL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the original methodology proposed by Kaltsas et al,1 the isolate inoculum was reported as the inoculum introduced into the bottle that already contains between 30-40 mL of growth media (depending on the manufacturer).\nWe have opted to report the final inoculum in each bottle accounting for the growth media dilution effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary (ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\nwp1 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/wp1a.csv\")\nfig1 <-ggplot(wp1, aes(x=inoculum_adj, y=tpos, color=isolates, shape=diluent, fill=isolates)) + geom_point(size=4, alpha = 0.5) + \nscale_y_continuous(name=\"Tpos (hr)\", limits=c(4,12)) +\ntheme(legend.text=element_text(size=12)) +\ngeom_smooth(aes(linetype=diluent), method=lm , color=\"black\", fill=\"#69b3a2\", se=TRUE, inherit.aes = TRUE )\nfig1 + theme_bw(base_size = 14)+ scale_x_log10(name=\"Inoculum CFU/mL\", breaks = trans_breaks(\"log10\",n=7, function(x) 10^x),labels = trans_format(\"log10\", math_format(10^.x)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(forestmangr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nwp1 <- read.csv(\"~/Desktop/ACUTEWEBSITE/wp1a.csv\")\ndf <- data.frame (wp1)\ntable1<-lm_table(df, log(inoculum) ~ tpos, \"diluent\")\nkbl(table1)%>%\nkable_paper(\"hover\", full_width = F, position=\"left\")\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    diluent \n    b0 \n    b1 \n    Rsqr \n    Rsqr_adj \n    Std.Error \n  \n \n\n  \n    pbs \n    32.05074 \n    -2.564975 \n    0.9343070 \n    0.9336227 \n    1.110872 \n  \n  \n    serum \n    33.02361 \n    -2.840223 \n    0.9231703 \n    0.9216023 \n    1.210130"

    "text": "Package 1B\nThis workpackage explores how antibiotic concentrations impact Tpos. \nThe effect of increasing fixed ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) concentrations (4:1) on Tpos was investigated at an inoculum of 1x104 CFU/mL of K. pneumoniae KPC_B (MIC X mg/L) and K. pneumonia NDM producing isolate (negative control, MIC X mg/L ). All experiments were performed in triplicate with an incubation period of 24 hours. Figure 2 shows a marked increased in the Tpos for KPC_B from < 10 hrs to > 24 hrs when CAZ/AVI concentrations surpassed 1 mg/L. In contrast, the negative control KPC_NDM strain exhibited consistent Tpos < 10hr at all test concentrations consistent with lack of antimicrobial activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDrug concentrations reported in figures represent the concentration of antibiotic injected (1 mL) into the bottle- “simulating” the antibiotic concentrations that would be detected in the bloodstream. These concentrations do not account for 40 mL growth median and inoculum (1 mL) in the bottle= total volume 42 mL.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "The project will generate fundamental knowledge of how Tpos correlates with established pharmacodynamic indices (e.g. AUC/MIC, %T> MIC). The activity of ceftazidime-avibactam monotherapy, and combination antibiotic regimens will be tested in vitro and using sera from patients undergoing treatment for KPC-carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of this project will be accomplished through two specific aims and several workpackages:\n\nThe first specific aim will establish the quantitative relationship between Tpos and representative KPC-Kp strains in the absence and presence of clinically-relevant antibiotic exposures.\nThe second specific aim will measure Tpos using sera from 20 critically-ill patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam treatment for KPC-KP bloodstream infections using KPC-Kp “indicator” strains or the patient’s own isolate. Tpos results will be correlated with blood concentration-time courses of ceftazidime and avibactam and PK/PD target attainment (free drug T>MIC ) simulated for each patient using Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from population pharmacokinetic models and LC/MS/MS analysis of ceftazidime-avibactam drug concentrations in serum.\n\nThis study will form the basis for the broader development and validation of Tpos as a surrogate pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for monitoring antimicrobial activity of antibiotic monotherapy and combination therapy for Gram-negative infections."
