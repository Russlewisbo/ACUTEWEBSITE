## WORKPACKAGE 1B: EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATIONS on TPOS

### METHODS

-   The activity of combination ceftazidime/avibactam (4 to 1 ratio from commercial formulation) plus gentamicin (0-4 mg/L) was tested against *Klebsiella pneumonia* KPCB strain in 5 replicate experiments using an array of test concentrations.

    ![Test array](test_array.png){width="500"}

-   The effect of the antibiotic combinations Tpos combination was analyzed using a Bliss Independence Model of drug interaction using a workflow described for the [synergy analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BIGL/vignettes/analysis.html) using the BIGL package.[@BIGL]

-   The first step of the fitting procedure analyzed marginal data only, i.e.-those observations within the experiment where one of the compounds is dosed at zero. For each compound the corresponding marginal doses are modelled using a 4-parameter logistic model

-   The marginal models will be estimated together using non-linear least squares estimation procedure. A simple sum-of-squared-residuals minimization driven by a default Nelder-Mead algorithm from `optim` minimizer was used.

-   Presence of synergistic or antagonistic effects was formalized by means of the meanR and maxR test. `meanR` test evaluates how the predicted response surface based on a specified null model differs from the observed one. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this test suggests that at least some dose combinations may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviour. The `meanR` test is not designed to pinpoint which combinations produce these effects nor what type of deviating effect is present.

-   `maxR` test allows to evaluate presence of synergistic/antagonistic effects for each dose combination and as such provides a point-by-point classification.

### RESULTS

#### Ceftazidime-avibactam + gentamicin

-   The results shown in [@fig-10wp2] demonstrated that CTZ/AVI + gentamicin is broadly synergistic over the range of tested concentrations, with and average 4.29 hr increase (95% CI 2.65-6.46) in Tpos versus the predicted null interactive response of ceftazidime-avibactam and gentamicin alone.
