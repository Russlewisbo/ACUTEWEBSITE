## Inoculum preparation

The proposed method are a modification of Tpos assay as proposed by Kaltsas et al. [@kaltsas2005]

Dilution schemes are from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [M21-A Methodology for the Serum Bactericidal Test](CLSI_M21A.pdf) [@Clinical_Laboratory_Standards_Institute1999-iya]and [M26A Methodology for Determining Bactericidal Activity of Antibiotics](CLSI_M26A.pdf) [@Clinical_Laboratory_Standards_Institute1999-iy]

To prepare a standardized inoculum (1.5 x10^2^ CFU/mL) for injection in blood culture bottles:

1.  Colonies are selected from an 18- to 24-hour agar plate and suspended in sterile 0.9% phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a glass test tube. The suspension is then adjusted by optimal density using a Densichek turbidity meter to an equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard corresponding to 1 to 2 × 10^8^ CFU/mL.
2.  The inoculum is then serially diluted using ten-fold dilution scheme: 200 μL inoculum dispensed by micropipette into 1800 μL 0.9% saline → vortexed → then 200 μL of this suspension is pipetted into a fresh tube containing 1800 μL 0.9% saline, etc.) until a final inoculum of **1.5 x10^2^ CFU/ml is reached**.

3.  Note the final dilution step is repeated an additional 5 times in replicate tubes to ensure 6 tubes (12 mL of the final 1.5 x10^2^ CFU/mL) are available to inoculate 10 blood culture bottles.

## Antibiotic preparation

1.  Analytical grade (\> 99% pure) ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL) pure powder are diluted separately in sterile water to prepare a stock solution of ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) and avibactam (500 μg/mL). The stock solution is dispensed into 2 mL sterile cryo-vials and stored at -20°C.

2.  Frozen stock antibiotic solution in cryo-vials is thawed the day of the experiment and diluted at twice the final test concentration using either (a) pooled patient serum; or (b) 0.9% PBS.

    -   Example: to obtain 2 mL of 20 mcg/ml stock: 200 μL of ceftazidime 200 mg/mL solution is pipetted into a test-tube containing 1800 μL of serum

    -   Example to obtain 50 μg/mL: using the multipipettor set at 500 μL, 500 μL of ceftazidime 200 μg/ml solution are added in a tube containing 1500 μL of serum

    -   500 μL of the ceftazidime 2x concentration and 500 μL of the 2x avibactam concentration are then added in a test tube to obtain 1 ml of serum-antibiotic solution at the desired concentrations

3.  After vortexing for 7-10 seconds each tube, 1 ml of inoculum suspension at 1.5x10^2^ CFU/mL and 1 mL of antibiotic containing serum are inoculated with a sterile insulin syringe into a blood culture bottle containing 40 mL of enrichment broth *without* inactivating matrix.

4.  Bloodcultre bottles are then incubated into Bact/ALERT system to detect growth. The same procedure is repeated for all the selected antibiotic concentration-inoculum pairs.

5.  One bottle is inoculated with the bacterial inoculum without adding the antibiotic solution (drug-free control).
